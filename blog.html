<h1>First day with html (4/3/2020)</h1>
<h2> What Challenges or troubles did you have completeing this assignment. how did you solve them? </h2>
<p>I had trouble putting an image in since I wasn't sure if the image had to be published online or not, in fact i am still not sure. For now, I have it directly on the directory. Another issue is which link to use for the index.html file to link to this code blog. Do i use "blog.html" or do I use the link after i publish blog.html? I think that both work right now, and possibly when i publish it will require us to use the actual published link. </p>
<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know? </h2>
<p> I learned how simple it is to create a simple webpage using html. I already knew some basic logic from past experience, like there needs to be a closing to a line after "opening" it. In terms of actual syntax, I had no previous experience with html so it is all new to me.</p>
<h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the clsas piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completeing this assignment? Howdid you use these resources?</h2>
<p>Stack overflow and other sites that pop up after googling an issue are very useful to me. I also checked piazza many times to see if my question is already on there. I have yet to ask my own questions but will start once I get deeper into the assignment.</p>


<h1> Assignment 2 (4/27/2020) </h1>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? </h2>
<p>The challenging part was trying to find out how to specifically do certain things such as the alignments and posititons of objects. Honestly, I was very confused from the beginning, I tried to look at the notes that Hess wrote for CSS but it was very basic and so I had to do much more research. The struggle was figuring out how to search what I am looking for and also how to find good articles about the subject. Piazza was very helpful with the tips that the TA's posted and pinneed, but even the tips were a little confusing for me somethings. The links they provided were very helpful for those parts, but for any other parts I had to ask fellow classmates and do a little bit of research myself too. The most difficult part was the flex boxes contents. getting them to align was difficult and then the navbar was confusing too because I had a hard time imagining them as flex objects too. Plus the button on the bottom right, it shocked me that the font size would be the function used for the little symbol.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew? </h2>
<p> I learned a lot about CSS from this assignment, I feel confident in building simple websites now. I also realized that so much goes into the tiny little details on every webpage I go on. I am so used to going to a nicely done website and just expecting everything to be even and work, I didn't realize so much went into even a simple layout. I already knew that I would have a lot of trouble copying certain things from the mocks.</p>
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources? </h2>
<p>Stack overflow was not that useful this time around, piazza was useful with the links the TA's provided. There were also some students with similar problems that got advice on there. Also googling helped a little, but sometimes wasted my time as I read through the whole thing and realized it didn't answer my questions. </p>
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment? </h2>
<p> how to center flex boxes and how to center text. Plus how to edit margins.</p>

<h1> Assignment 3 (5/11/2020) </h1>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p> The challenging part was figuring out how the complicated aspect of javascript in tandem with css and html worked. I was quite confused since there was a lot of class vs ID vs tag name issues. I asked for help from classmates and did a lot of googling. I also checked piazza. </p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p>I learned a ton of javascript specifics for example the creating twit took a while and i confused myself many times with wrong naming mechanisms or confusing naming mechanisms. Since I knew Java before this, the logic was very much the same and syntax too except for creating functions.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p>Stack overflow was helpful, code from lectures were helpful, and piazza was also helpful sometimes. I mostly googled and checked the cs 290 website for sources on the basics, but obviously the assignment was far from basic. </p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p>How to do search bar functions in javascript and how to make events like keyup.</p>

<h1> Assignment 4 (5/18/2020) </h1>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p> I think it was challenging to understand the instructions this time around becuase I got super confused with the caching/saving part of the files. it does say that it can only read files once in the server, but real cacheing is different and not just reading files once. </p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p> I learned a lot about servers and host ports and how they work with the browser. The only thing i already knew was how to store files into variables and then call on them later.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p> Stack overflow again was helpful along with some other articles i found through google and then piazza was a little helpful this time too.</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p> How to cache and how to change my code to accept an environment port number.</p>

<h1>Assignment 5 (6/1/2020)</h1>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p>The most challenging was figuring out how to implement handlebars into my assignment and how it applied. Plus I was continually getting the error for Handlebars as an uncaught reference error and i may still not be able to complete that before the assignment is due... I asked on piazza and asked friends in the class. I also struggled with getting the handlebar files straight.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p>I learned a lot about Handlebars and Express for sure and how to play around with server controls and code. I found that I already knew the js things.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p>Piazza and stack overflow and the reccomended websites on the main page. I simply googled or asked for help directly.</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p>Uncaught ReferenceError: Handlebars not defined. Never quite found an answer that fixed the problem and also how to connect the Handlebars.</p>
