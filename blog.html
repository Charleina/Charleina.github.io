<h1>First day with html (4/3/2020)</h1>
<h2> What Challenges or troubles did you have completeing this assignment. how did you solve them? </h2>
<p>I had trouble putting an image in since I wasn't sure if the image had to be published online or not, in fact i am still not sure. For now, I have it directly on the directory. Another issue is which link to use for the index.html file to link to this code blog. Do i use "blog.html" or do I use the link after i publish blog.html? I think that both work right now, and possibly when i publish it will require us to use the actual published link. </p>
<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know? </h2>
<p> I learned how simple it is to create a simple webpage using html. I already knew some basic logic from past experience, like there needs to be a closing to a line after "opening" it. In terms of actual syntax, I had no previous experience with html so it is all new to me.</p>
<h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the clsas piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completeing this assignment? Howdid you use these resources?</h2>
<p>Stack overflow and other sites that pop up after googling an issue are very useful to me. I also checked piazza many times to see if my question is already on there. I have yet to ask my own questions but will start once I get deeper into the assignment.</p>
