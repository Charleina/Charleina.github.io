<h2>On a scale from 0 (I've never even seen HTML code) to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how confident are you in your web development skills?</h2>
<p> I have seen html code but also have no idea how to write it myself until now so I will say 0.1. </p>
<h2>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h2>
<p> I hope to learn how to make my own webpages and also start learning how to design more complex pages too. I am super excited to learn since I enjoy coding and would love to understand how the web pages I use everyday work. </p>
<h2>Have you signed up for Piazza?</h2>
<p> Yes I have.</p>
<h2> Most Interesting Fact About me </h2>
<p> I would say that I have trained for some time in <em>Krav Maga</em> the Israel Self Defense Martial Art which is more of a combination of many different maratial arts, boxing, and wrestling. It was quite difficult to learn due to the fact that your body has to adjust to training before you can do much more. This involved practicing "inside Defenses" which is blocking straight punches to the face. This exercise gave me bruises up and down my arms everytime. Overtime, I noticed that although it still hurt to block punches, my arms bruised less and less. This is what I mean by your body has to adjust to training, in other words be able to take hits. I think that it is a very intense martial art.</p>
